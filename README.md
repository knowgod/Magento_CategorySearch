Magento_CategorySearch
======================
Have you ever been bored with looking for the needed category?
This will help you to find the match quickly.

Apply filters to category tree. This allows you to find specific categories in big categories list without reading each category name.
Category search is available in admin panel:
<ul>
<li>Catalog > Manage Categories;</li>
<li>Catalog > Manage Products > Edit product >Categories tab;</li>
<li>CMS > Static Blocks > insert widget (category link);</li>
<li>CMS > Pages > insert widget (category link).</li>
</ul>

The search can be performed by plain string or even regular expression.
